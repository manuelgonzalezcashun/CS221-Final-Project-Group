GAME RULES
    --- Player draws 2 values between 2-11
    --- Player continues to draw until they reach 21, choose to fold (stop drawing cards), or bust (exceed 21)
    --- 11 acts as the Ace, if the Player busts but has an 11 in their hand it becomes a 1 and the player can continue drawing or fold
    --- If the Player draws an 11 (Ace) and 10 from their first two values they will have reached 21 and automatically fold
    --- If the Player folds the Dealer will then draw 2 values between 2-11 and continue to draw until they reach 21, fold, or bust
