GAME RULES
    --- Player draws a value between 1-11, then Computer draws a value between 1-11
    --- Player continues to draw until they reach 21, choose to fold (stop drawing cards), or bust (exceed 21)
    --- 11 acts as the Ace, if the Player busts but has an 11 in their hand it becomes a 1 and the player can continue drawing or fold
    --- If the Player draws an 11 (Ace) and 10 from their first two values they will have reached 21 and automatically fold
    --- If the Player folds the Dealer will then draw a value between 1-11 and continue to draw until they reach 21, fold (at 16 or greater), or bust

    Player Win Cases:
	  - The Player reaches 21
	  - The Player folds with a score closer to 21 than the Dealer
	  
    Dealer Win Cases:
